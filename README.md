# Music_Recommendation_Engine

## Major Work Done & Main Functionalities
• Developed a music recommendation engine using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**, and **SciPy**, to suggest songs to users based on their listening history.

• Preprocessed and cleaned a dataset of over 48 million rows, optimizing memory usage and gaining insights into data distribution using visualization techniques.

• Implemented three recommendation methods, including **leaderboard-based recommendations**, **collaborative filtering with Jaccard similarity coefficient**, and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. 

• The system was capable of generating personalized music recommendations, enhancing user engagement and retention.
